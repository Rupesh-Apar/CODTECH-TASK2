Overview
This is a simple weather forecast app that displays the weather conditions for a few predefined locations (New York, London, and Tokyo). The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The weather data is hardcoded and does not use an external API.

Project Structure
index.html: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the app.
styles.css: The CSS file that styles the app.
script.js: The JavaScript file that handles the logic and interactivity of the app.

Features
Displays the temperature and weather condition for selected locations.
Users can select a location from a dropdown menu to view the corresponding weather information.

How to Use
download the repository.
Open index.html in your web browser.
Use the dropdown menu to select a location. The weather information for the selected location will be displayed below the dropdown.

Future Enhancements
Dynamic Data: Integrate with a weather API to fetch real-time weather data.
Additional Locations: Add more locations and weather details.
Improved UI/UX: Enhance the design and user interface of the app.

Conclusion
This setup provides a basic structure for a weather forecast app. You can further expand and improve this project by adding more features, enhancing the design, or integrating real-time data using APIs.
